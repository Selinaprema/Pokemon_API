# Pokemon API Data Retrieval

## Description
This task involves using **promises** to make an **API call** that retrieves information about a specific Pokemon. The program fetches data from the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/squirtle/) and displays relevant details about the Pokemon, such as:
- Name
- Weight
- Abilities

You can replace the default Pokemon character `{squirtle}` with the name of any other Pokemon by using their name in the API link.

## Features

  - Replace `{squirtle}` in the API URL with any other Pokemon name (e.g., `pikachu`, `bulbasaur`).

- **Extract and Display Information**
  - Retrieve and display the following information:
    - Pokemon **Name**
    - Pokemon **Weight**
    - Pokemon **Abilities**

- **User-Friendly Console Output**
